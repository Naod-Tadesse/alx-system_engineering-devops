**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** April 13, 2024, 10:00 PM UTC to April 14, 2024, 3:00 AM UTC
- **Impact:** Our main web application experienced intermittent downtime, with approximately 30% of users affected by slow response times and occasional service disruptions.
- **Root Cause:** A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to uneven distribution of traffic among backend servers, causing overload and degraded performance.

**Timeline:**
- **April 13, 2024, 10:15 PM UTC:** Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating increased latency.
- **April 13, 2024, 10:30 PM UTC:** Engineers began investigating the issue, suspecting database overload initially.
- **April 13, 2024, 11:00 PM UTC:** Load balancer logs reviewed, suggesting potential imbalance in traffic distribution.
- **April 13, 2024, 11:30 PM UTC:** Misleading assumption made that recent code deployment might have caused database performance issues.
- **April 14, 2024, 12:00 AM UTC:** Incident escalated to the infrastructure team for deeper analysis.
- **April 14, 2024, 1:00 AM UTC:** Load balancer configuration double-checked, revealing misconfigured settings.
- **April 14, 2024, 2:00 AM UTC:** Load balancer settings corrected, restoring balanced traffic distribution.
- **April 14, 2024, 3:00 AM UTC:** Web application performance stabilized, and service fully restored.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:** Misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused uneven distribution of traffic among backend servers, leading to overload and degraded performance.
- **Resolution:** Load balancer settings were corrected to evenly distribute traffic among backend servers, restoring normal performance.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automated configuration checks for load balancer settings to detect anomalies.
  - Enhance monitoring to provide more granular insights into traffic distribution and server performance.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations to ensure consistency across environments.
  2. Develop and implement automated tests to validate load balancer configurations after updates or deployments.
  3. Enhance documentation and training for operations teams regarding load balancer management and troubleshooting procedures.
  4. Schedule regular audits of critical infrastructure components to identify and address potential misconfigurations proactively.
  
By addressing the root cause and implementing preventive measures, we aim to minimize the risk of similar incidents in the future, ensuring a more resilient and reliable web stack for our users.
